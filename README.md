99-Haskell-Problems
===================

99 Problems from http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/H-99:_Ninety-Nine_Haskell_Problems

The solutions are in no way optimized and error checking is nonexistent, at best. `Finished` below simply means that it works in normal use cases.
I haven't been aiming for tail recursion or even preventing prime numbers from being generated more than once, for example.
This repository is solely for learning the basics of Haskell. I aimed to use only very simple prelude functions -- eg. `head, tail, take` for the first few problems.

`DNE` means the problem does not exist.
