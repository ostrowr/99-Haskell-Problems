99-Haskell-Problems
===================

99 Problems from http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/H-99:_Ninety-Nine_Haskell_Problems

I haven't been aiming for tail recursion or even preventing prime numbers from being generated more than once, for example.
This repository is solely for learning the basics of Haskell.
